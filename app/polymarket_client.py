"""
Thin client around Polymarket's public read APIs.

Three APIs are involved:
  - Gamma API (metadata): market question, slug, close time, and the two
    CLOB token ids (one per outcome: Up / Down).
  - CLOB API (live pricing): midpoint/last-trade price per token id, and
    the real order book (best bid / best ask) via get_book().

NOTE: Polymarket's public API surface has shifted field names between
versions in the past. This module is the single place to patch if a
response shape doesn't match what's below -- everything else in the app
only talks to WindowMarket / get_price(), not to raw HTTP responses.
Verify once against a live window after your first deploy; if a field
name is off, `_extract_token_ids` / `_parse_market_json` are the two
functions to fix.
